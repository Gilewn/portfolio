          <h3>Broadway</h3>
          <p>A very simple start up project which contains only a home page.
          On rails I have created a controller for the page, an action and a root route.
        Also some CSS styles of my choice.</p></a>
        </li>
      <li class="col-lg-4"><a href="https://github.com/Gilewn/bolt-network">
        <%= image_tag("bolt-network_small.png", alt: "bolt-network") %>
        <h3>Bolt Network</h3>
        <p>Also a project with simple tasks. This project has an extra page (About) and two links
           to connect the home page with the about page.</p></a>
      </li>
      <li class="col-lg-4"><a href="https://github.com/Gilewn/innovation-cloud">
        <%= image_tag("innovation-cloud_small.png", alt: "innovation-cloud")%>
        <h3>Innovation Cloud</h3>
        <p>In this project a model is added (Signups),a POST request to save the emails, a resource route for signups
        and a Thank you page after the signup is saved.</p></a>
      </li>
    </div>
  </ul>
  <ul class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <li class="col-lg-4"><a href="https://github.com/Gilewn/threadly">
        <%= image_tag("threadly_small.png", alt: "threadly") %>
        <h3>Threadly</h3>
        <p>One page to share comments. Each comment is captured immediately after it is saved
           and you have the ability to write the next one. A model named Posts is created,
            with two instance variables at the Posts controller @new_post and @all_posts.
          The rest is CSS.</p></a>
      </li>
      <li class="col-lg-4"><a href="https://github.com/Gilewn/bookmarks">
        <%= image_tag("bookmarks_small.png", alt: "bookmarks") %>
        <h3>Bookmarks</h3>
        <p>A project to learn associations. I have created two models (books,reviews) and associated them with
        the has_many/belongs_to associations, then I created two views (index,show)
         one with a list of all books and one with each book separately with its reviews. Not much CSS style.</p></a>
      </li>
      <li class="col-lg-4"><a href="https://github.com/Gilewn/bass-music">
        <%= image_tag("bass-music_small.png", alt: "bass-music")%>
        <h3>Bass Music</h3>
        <p>Like Bookmarks, instead of books and reviews, now we have albums and tracks.A little prettier,
           but not CSS style too.</p></a>
      </li>
